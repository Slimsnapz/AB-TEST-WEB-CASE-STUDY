# AB-TEST-WEB-CASE-STUDY
# A/B Testing Analysis: Website Click-Through Rate Optimization
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive A/B testing analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of a new website design on user click-through rates (CTR). Using real-world data from an e-commerce platform, I performed statistical hypothesis testing to determine if implementing a redesigned interface (experimental group) resulted in significantly higher CTR compared to the original design (control group).

## Key Objectives
Determine if the new design statistically significantly improves CTR

Assess whether the observed difference is practically significant for business decisions

Visualize results and confidence intervals for stakeholder communication

Implement proper statistical methodology for trustworthy conclusions

## Technical Approach
### Data Analysis Workflow:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and explored 20,000 user interaction records

Descriptive Analysis: Calculated baseline CTR metrics for both groups

**Statistical Testing:**

Implemented two-sample proportion z-test

Calculated p-values and confidence intervals

Evaluated both statistical and practical significance

Visualization: Created intuitive plots to communicate results

Key Statistical Concepts Applied:
Hypothesis testing (Null vs Alternative)

Statistical significance (Î± = 0.05)

Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE = 10%)

Confidence interval analysis

Pooled variance estimation

Gaussian distribution visualization

Tools Used
Python: Primary analysis language

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy: Numerical computations

SciPy: Statistical functions and hypothesis testing

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis environment

Skills Demonstrated
Statistical Analysis:

Gaussian distribution with rejection regions

Confidence interval plots

Experimental Design:

Proper A/B test setup

Sample size consideration

Practical significance evaluation

Business Insight Translation:

Statistical results to business recommendations

Risk assessment (Type I/II errors)

Key Findings
Statistical Significance:

Experimental group showed 61.16% CTR vs 19.89% for control

P-value < 0.0001 (Reject null hypothesis)

Z-score = 58.07 (Exceeds critical value)

Practical Significance:

Difference in CTR (41.27%) exceeds MDE threshold (10%)

95% CI: (41.03%, 41.51%) doesn't contain zero

Visual Evidence:

Clear separation in CTR distributions between groups

Test statistic falls in rejection region

Confidence interval demonstrates substantial improvement

Business Implications
The analysis provides strong evidence that the redesigned interface:

Significantly improves user engagement (p < 0.0001)

Exceeds practical significance threshold (41% improvement)

Should be implemented site-wide

Could potentially increase conversion rates by 41%
